# Project 4: Final Submission

## Game Idea and Implementations


### Game Title: Cave of Despair

### Story

> ********************************The player wakes up groggily from a fall. They can see the light above, but calling out for helps results in no avail. Looking around, two paths to unfamiliar territory lie. Which direction will you go, player, to make it out of the Cave of Despair?********************************
> 

### Initial Conditions

- The player begins with 70hp, just shy of the 100hp possible throughout the game
- The player also has a couple of items in their inventory, with tutorial messages (written by the last person to explore the cave, wink wink) guiding the player through the mechanics of the game, such as HP, inventory, hints, sleep and time, etc.
- The players obstacles are twofold: rooms contain mobs, puzzles, and at points other variations of items they can interact with. Mobs may spring to defend a room, add amb
    - ⚠️ Whether or not these rooms are randomly generated or not, I don’t know. There could be a threshold the player reaches before fighting the “final boss” in the “final room”. A mix of random and nonrandom generation?? To be explored.

## Official Project Requirements

> You should create a document that lists all the improvements you made, and a brief
explanation of what specifically you did for each improvement. (Sometimes there will be very little to say, but if the improvement gave you freedom to choose how things would work, you should say what you chose. If you have to add a new type of monster, for example, say what type you added and what if anything is special about it. You should also have a quick note about what code in what files was added/modified to make this work.)

### Brainstorm

- [ ]  Monsters have “death drops”
    - When you defeat a monster, it will drop a useful item
- [ ]  Food system
    - Includes player hunger as well as food items that replenish this hunger
- [ ]  Potions??
    - These potions either heal, replenish tiredness, buff attack, etc
