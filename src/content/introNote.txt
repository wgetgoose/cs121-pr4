Forlorn here I write in warning, to those who travel after me.
The cave from here is treacherous. Evils line the crevices of
those who dare to enter. Yet, one is left no choice. Do as I have,
kill the knaves that line the cellars, and you will find salvation.
Whether one is the same man after this journey, alas, is your own question.
Pursue with vigilance,
Jeremiah
