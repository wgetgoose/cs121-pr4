Forlorn here I write in warning, to those who travel after me.
The cave from here is treacherous. Evils line the crevices of
those who dare to enter. Yet, one is left no choice. Do as I have,
kill the knaves that line the cellars, and you will find salvation.
From hither your first task is so slay Gregory - for this reward is granted.
Here my advice ends, 
the rest, alas, is your own question.
Pursue with vigilance,

--- Jeremiah
