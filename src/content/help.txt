                        --- Cave of Despair ---
Welcome to the help menu! Here are the "rules" behind the game
    - Items
        - Your inventory is limited to 5 items
        - Weapon: your fighting tool
        - Potion: heals
        - Note:   various messages that can be read throughout the game
    - Combat
        - During combat, your currently equipped weapon is used to calculate damage dealt
        - Monsters deal constant damage
        - You have a 50/50 chance of "going first" in combat
        - Players have a 10% critical hit chance, which deals 1.5x damage
        - Monsters have varying critical hit chances depending on their difficulty
        - Potions can be used to heal before, during, or after combat
    - Save
        - You can save your game at any time except for active combat
        - There is nothing preventing you from abusing the save system, but that's no fun
